Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions data from 1960 to 2020. CO2 emissions, primarily originating from energy production and use, are a major contributor to greenhouse gases and global warming. The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard to provide insights into the historical trends of CO2 emissions and identify the leading countries in terms of emissions over the past six decades.

Data Source
The project utilizes CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) data for various countries, sourced from 1960 to 2020. This comprehensive dataset forms the basis of our analysis and visualization.

Data Preparation
Data Cleaning: The project uses Tableau's Data Interpreter feature to address column errors, null values, and ensure data accuracy. The year's were spread across columns which was pivoted to analyse further.
Interactive Dashboard
The project culminates in an interactive dashboard with four components, offering a variety of views and insights into CO2 emissions data.

1. Symbol Map
A symbol map (bubble map) visualizes CO2 emissions for all countries.
Users can observe the emissions in a geographic context, facilitating cross-country comparisons.
Enhanced with size scaling and a Red-Blue Diverging Color Palette.
2. Line Charts
Continuous line charts depict CO2 emissions from 1960 to 2020 for all countries.
Each country is represented by a unique color for tracking emissions trends over time.
3. Running Total and Area Chart
Running totals of CO2 emissions are presented as an area chart for specific countries, including Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and Luxembourg.
4. Top 10 Countries (2010-2020)
A stacked bar chart showcases CO2 emissions of the top 10 countries from 2010 to 2020.
Users can filter the data to explore emissions in this critical period.
User Interaction
Quick filters are provided, enabling users to refine the data based on their interests and research needs.
This helps for exploration and a deeper understanding of the data.
Action highlighter is also used to make it more interactive and provide more insights.
